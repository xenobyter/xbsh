# xbsh

## Introduction

This private project is for learning purposes only. It is intended to build some sort of command-shell in [Go](golang.org).

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/xenobyter/xbsh
```

## Contribute

As this project has a focus on learning with no intended practical use, it must be very unlikely for someone to even bother to contribute. Nevertheless any contributions are welcome. Feel free to comment, file an issue or open a PR.
